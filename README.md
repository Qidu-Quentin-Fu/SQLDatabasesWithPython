## 1 Introduction 
These repository includes two projects, specifically, these two project aim for the tasks below respectively:
- project1 (multi-table databases): Build and join tables/database to organize musical tracks with artists, albums, and genres on the [give dataset](http://www.py4e.com/code3/tracks.zip)
- project2 (mapping students and classes): Build and join tables/dataset to organize students/classes memberships on the [given dataset](https://www.py4e.com/tools/sql-intro/roster_data.php?PHPSESSID=3d761449819ed661d68425bb071933cb)

## Methodology
To complete the aformentioned tasks, my project code files:
- (project 1) read an iTunes export file in XML and produce a properly normalized database
- (project 2) read roster data in JSON format, parse the file, and then produce an SQLite database that contains a User, Course, and Member table and populate the tables
